# Checkpoint Project Python - Terminal Adventure
After finishing the Checkpoint Projects "Paper, Scissors, Rocks" and "Area Calculator", I wanted to try something fun for "Terminal Adventure"! I created a Mini Pokémon Game!
- Starting by meeting Professor Oak and introducing yourself, you can pick your starter pokémon. Your choice lies in between Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle (real OGs know that Gen1 was the best)!
- Then, your best (rival) friend Cody appears who has also picked a starter pokémon (random) and wants to have his first fight with you! Do your best to defeat Cody! Together, you can do it!
- You can try this game as much as you want! Maybe you can choose another starter pokémon next time? Or use another strategy? It's your choice!
